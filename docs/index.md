# CodeBox API

The simplest SandBoxing solution for your LLM Agents.

## Why is SandBoxing important?

When deploying LLM Agents to production, it is important to ensure
that the code they run is safe and does not contain any malicious code.
This is especially important when considering prompt injection, which
could give an attacker access to the entire system.

## How does CodeBox work?

CodeBox uses a cloud hosted system to run hardened containers
that are designed to be secure. These containers are then used to
run the code that is sent to the API. This ensures that the code
is run in a secure environment, and that the code cannot access
the host system.
